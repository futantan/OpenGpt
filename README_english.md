# OpenGpt

Website: https://open-gpt.app/

I've noticed a lot of exciting projects based on #OpenAI recently. I believe that everyone should have the ability to create such projects to solve their own problems. With that in mind, I'm creating an AI platform that enables users to create their own #ChatGPT applets, which will be open-source. I'll be updating progress in real-time on Twitter. I welcome you to like and follow!

- On March 8, 2023, we completed the first stage of enabling users to create their own apps.

- As of March 11, 2023, the number of apps created by users has exceeded 800! ðŸ¤¯ ðŸ¤¯ ðŸ¤¯
- [x] Support users to use their own API tokens to liberalize the rate limit
- [x] We organize apps that are not easy to use and hide them from the homepage.
