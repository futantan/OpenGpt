I've seen a lot recently based on #OpenAI project. Each of us should have the ability to create these projects to solve our own problems. 
I'm going to create an AI platform that all users can use and create #ChatGPT applets. Open Source!
The progress will be pushed in real time on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EclipsePrayer)
